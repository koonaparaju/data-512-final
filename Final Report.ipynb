    "## Introduction\n",
    "Globalization increased interdependence between countries in terms of trade and technology. Globalization also allwoed international companies to expand to multiple countires. Globalization also seemed to have caused increase in enegy consumption by countries. This inturn casues CO2 emissions to go up in these countries. \n",
    "In recent climate change conferences developing countries are considered to be big pollutors. Developing economies have energy needs to support their economies and lead to pollution. Developed countries were asked to innovate ways to curb the growing emissions. In this article I choose to look at 3 countries, USA, India and China to look into globalization inde and energy consumption. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also belive that increased energy consumption and industrialization caused an increase in GDP of countries. There are many indicators of quality of life. In this article I want to use GDP as one of the indicators to indetify increase in wealth of the citizens of hte countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions to explore\n",
    "I want to understand how globalization has shifted energy needs from developed countries to developing countries.  If globalization helped developing economies support their citizens they could be paying a price in pollution which could be impacting the health. \n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis is globalizaton increased energy consumption for developing economies and decreased the enery consumption of developed countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second quesion I want to pursue is improvement in quality of life in developing countries as a result of globalization. \n",
    "This is very broad question we can answer this with GDP, mortality rate, education and health metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis is globalization improved the quality of life developing countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data set\n",
    "The data set to use for this analysis is [world development indicators](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators). This data has close to 1600 indicators. Energy consumption and infrastructure metrics are tracked on a per country level. More information on the indicators can be found [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator).\n",
    "This data is public and uses CC-BY 4.0 licenses. It is permitted to download, redistribute the data with proper attribution \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "KOF Globalisation Index is used to track the spread of globalization of each contries. The data set is avilable for download [here](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/dual/kof-dam/documents/Medienmitteilungen/Globalisierungsindex/KOFGI_2020_public.xlsx) The inde tracts 23 variables for each country and computes an index. The index is computed as described [here](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/dual/kof-dam/documents/Medienmitteilungen/Globalisierungsindex/KOFGI_2020_method.pdf) Description of the variables is provided [here](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/dual/kof-dam/documents/Medienmitteilungen/Globalisierungsindex/KOFGI_2020_variables.pdf) In this article I use the final index rather than individual values of the globalization index. I couldn't find an attached license to data but its available for download publicly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Copy of the data can be downloaded by python code below. The script assumes an active network connection to pull the data from its sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis in this case is mostly exploratory. I want to consider data from year 1970 onwards. There are enegry indicators for each country in the list. In the total energy consumption the indicator of interest is amount of energy imported. I want to look at energy consumption of countries like India, China and compare that to developed countries like USA countries. For the second question I am going to use GDP of economies. "
